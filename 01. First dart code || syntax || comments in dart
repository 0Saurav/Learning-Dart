//The entry point in dart is main to use syntax you should use void
//and add paranthesis and also curly bracket
//In between curly bracket program is written

void main(){
  
  //This is my first line of code
  print("Hello World");
  //you need to use double quote symbol and also semi colon to run
  print("This is my first Application");
  //to print number you can also not use double quote
  //you can solve mathematical functions while printing those number
  print(4+1);
  //you can also boolean values i.e. True or False
  print(true);
