//Data types and variables
//how to declare variables in dart
//what are built-in variables in dart
//what are literals??
//how to perform String interpolations
//various ways to declare constants in darts i.e. final keyword and const keyword
//data types that dart supports that are as below
//Numbers (int and double)
//Strings
//Booleans
//List(also known as arrays)
//Maps
//Runes(for expressing Unicode characters in a String)
//Symbols

//NOTE : ALL DATA TYPES IN DART ARE OBJECTS 
//THEREFORE, VALUES ARE BY DEFAULT NULL UNLESS WE INIALITIZE THEM


//To declare variable
//Define a value 21 (Let's say its your age)
// int age = 21; [int is data type || age is variable || 21 is value and a semi colon]
// or also var age =21; [It assigns integer automatically]

//Define a value "Xesen" (Let's say its your name)
// string name = "Xesen";
// or also var name ="Xesen";

//Define a value true [Person is alive = True OR dead = False]
// bool isAlive=True;
//or also var isAlive=True;

void main()
{
  int age = 21;
  var score = 8;
  int hexvalue = 0xEADEFB; //you're assigning hexvalue and it must be in 8 digits
  
  double percentage =100;
  var gpa=3.20;
  double exponents=1.42e5; //you're assigning exponential value
  
  String name = "Xesen";
  var company="Famed";
  
    bool isvalid; //defining bool object or name 
      isvalid=true; //assigning true or false to defined object or name
  
  //IF ANYTHING'S VALUE IS NOT DEFINED THAN ITS NULL 
  
  print(age);
  print(percentage);
  print(name);
  print(company);
  print(isvalid);
  print(score);
   print(hexvalue);
   print(gpa);
   print(exponents);
}
